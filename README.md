# OGR TOASTR

A simple toastr package.

## Installation

A simple and fast way to get started is to include it on your page:

```html

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/ogr-toastr@1.0.4/dist/style.css">
<script src="https://unpkg.com/ogr-toastr@1.0.4/dist/build.js"></script>
```

This will create the global variable `toast`.
## Usage

```html
<script>
    toast.success('Your password has been changed')
    toast.error('An error occurred!')
</script>
```
